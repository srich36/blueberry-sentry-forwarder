# Datadog to Sentry Log Forwarder

This project implements a log forwarder that receives logs from Datadog and forwards them to Sentry for centralized error tracking and monitoring.

## Overview

The log forwarder acts as a bridge between Datadog's logging infrastructure and Sentry's error tracking platform, allowing you to consolidate your monitoring and error tracking in one place.

## Deployment

Deploy the log forwarder using Wrangler:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```
